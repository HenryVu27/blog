## Content

### AI Engineering Series
- [Part 1: What Fills the Context Window](https://www.henryvu.blog/series/ai-engineering/part1.html): Comprehensive guide to context engineering for LLMs. Covers the seven components of a context window, four strategies (write, select, compress, isolate), failure modes, token budgets, and measuring context quality. 25 min deep dive.

### Multi-Armed Bandits Series
- [Part 1: Foundations](https://www.henryvu.blog/series/bandits/part1.html): Deep dive into the exploration-exploitation tradeoff. Covers regret, stochastic bandits, concentration inequalities, Explore-then-Commit, and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithms. Includes interactive visualizations.
